I try not to repeat myself when I know how to avoid it, and have gone back and removed most if not all duplicate code, as exhibited by [ServletUtilities](src/main/java/net/splatspot/utilities/ServletUtilities.java). I try to use packages and other files appropriately, in order to separate my code into relevant parts.

Hypothetically, I believe if I logged more information, while keeping security logs separate from other logs, both of these types of information could be valuable to writing and maintaining a good application. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                             |

This project taught me that coding a model (POJO/JavaBean) can be important not just for consuming responses, but also generating them. <br> I also have an idea of what could have been even better with the service if more time were provided. I think using a `switch` statement, while clever, could have been multiple methods with different `Path`s. These could process the data unique to them, then call shared method(s) to execute similar functionality. <br> A good practice I learned while consuming the Star Trek API is that good responses have defined, but null, values for unset data. This is featured in the team project when the user asks for a perimeter or area, but not both. <br> I'd love to learn more about making web services, and I've made much progress already. I believe this will be especially useful to me as I work on more practical projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                             |

Even with Java though, I believe I've demonstrated through [My Week 8 exercise](https://github.com/cdmckinley/EntJava-Week8-Exercise) which uses [ the Star Trek API abbreviated as STAPI](https://stapi.co) that I can not only consume web services, but do some clever things with their data as seen in the unit testing.

This can be expanded on by parameterizing these messages (analyzing them a token at a time for instance) for more complex communications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                             |

I've also learned more about generic classes (which I understood on a surface level, but finally learned how to make one this semester), and I've demonstrated my understanding of MVC. I've gotten a much better understanding of how patterns can be effective thanks to Object Oriented Programming. <br> In the team project, I made use of Object Oriented Programming, with an Interface and Polymorphism for working with different shapes. I try to keep my variables as specific scope as they can be without passing excessive/irrelevant data back and forth. <br> Another example of how I've noticed patterns is something I noticed in a YouTube Video once (it might be [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzwWWut_ibU)?), and I realize how it can be an effective pattern. It's setting up error handling to check for errors first, getting all bad paths out of the way, then working with the 'good paths.' It also keeps the checks and their responses in one place. It may not work for everything, but when it works, it can improve code legibility (reducing code-nesting). <br> I believe patterns are **essential** to writing code well. |                                                                                                                                             |

I think part of why I've struggled with this is that I've gotten my code nearly correct very early many times in the past. I've run into many more issues with Java, but still managed to either fix them or find an alternative approach. <br> I find it helps to run the program in debug mode, use breakpoints, watch for stack traces, and walk through my code while computing it mentally. If I still can't find the problem, at least I've read through context that will help my helpers to understand the issue. Remembering previous errors and their causes is also helpful, as coding is based in part on patterns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                             |

I'm also happy to give direction when I know someone is available and capable to do the work. I've also taken much initiative with the team project, though it was perhaps too much. I believe my ability to work within a team is sound, and I hope to learn soon how to better balance work between myself and the rest of the team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                             |

I try and be thoughtful of what I say, and also not to repeat what others have said when I can find something else to say. <br> I also believe that my strategy for peer feedback round 2 was more effective than it would have been if not for a specific idea: When I was low on sleep the first night of our feedback, I was afraid my lack of ability to focus would hinder my feedback. I asked if we could reschedule Eric's presentation to me. As this allowed me to give more complete attention, I believe it improved my ability to give effective feedback. <br> And even though I had a hard time accepting the following feedback at first, I responded to being told I was taking learning shortcuts by taking more time to consume the material, and not try to be so independent that my learning's and work's effectiveness were less.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                             |
