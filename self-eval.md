I think using a `switch` statement, while clever, could have been multiple methods with different `Path`s. These could process the data unique to them, then call shared method(s) to execute similar functionality. <br> I'd love to learn more, and I've made much progress already.

I've also worked with a team, and believe I've done well in doing so! I've been keeping my `.gitignore` file up-to-date. I'd love to learn `rebase` better, and updating a branch's upstream. I've also `reset` before.

I've also learned more about generic classes (which I understood on a surface level, but finally learned how to make one this semester)m], and I've demonstrated my understanding of MVC. I've gotten a much better understanding of how patterns can be effective thanks to Object Oriented Programming. Another example of how I've noticed patterns is something I noticed in a YouTube Video once, and I realize how it can be an effective pattern. It's setting up error handling to check for errors first, getting all bad paths out of the way, then working with the 'good paths.' It may not work for everything, but when it works, it can improve code legibility (reducing code-nesting). <br> I believe patterns are **essential** to writing code well.                                       |                                                                                                                                             |

I've run into many more issues with Java, but still managed to either fix them or find an alternative approach.

I'm also happy to give direction when I know someone is available and capable to do the work. I've also taken much initiative with the team project, though it was perhaps too much. I believe my ability to work within a team is sound, and I hope to learn soon how to better balance work between myself and the rest of the team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                             |

I try and be thoughtful of what I say, and also not to repeat what others have said when I can find something else to say. <br> I also believe that my strategy for peer feedback round 2 was more effective than it would have been if not for a specific idea: When I was low on sleep the first night of our feedback, I was afraid my lack of ability to focus would hinder my feedback. I asked if we could reschedule Eric's presentation to me. As this allowed me to give more complete attention, I believe it improved my ability to give effective feedback. <br> And even though I had a hard time accepting the following feedback at first, I responded to being told I was taking learning shortcuts by taking more time to consume the material, and not try to be so independent that my learning's and work's effectiveness were less. |                                                                                                                                             |

I also helped to explain pieces of the project that they didn't understand yet.                 | ***For the grade I'm aiming for:*** I'd argue that I've earned at least an AB, given everything I've learned and demonstrated, and my significant increase in effective learning and working.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                             |
