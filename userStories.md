# User Stories

### User Auth:
- I want to keep my information in a secure place, with minimal risk of my password leaking.

### User-information:
- I want to have persistent information so I don't have to re-type it every session.
- I want the information to connect to users shared automatically when I find someone to play with.
- When hosting a game, I want to know more easily which Splatoon 3 player is which Discord user. This will help me know I have the right people in my lobby.

### Finding a game:
- I want to know when users are looking to play, so we can chat while we wait for others, or set our own rules.

### Stretch Goal: Media Sharing:
- I want to share these moments of Splatoon 3, so I can enjoy them alongside others.
- I want to see when media is posted live in a feed on Discord, so I don't need to be on the website at all times.
- I want to browse for specific media that has been shared. Searching by video/fanart/meme, and by tags set by the user who posted, would be very helpful.
