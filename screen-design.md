# Screen design

### Mockup
The [Main page mockup](screen-designs/index.html) is located in the `screen-designs` directory. It features a custom icon, whose source file is in the `media` directory. This logo is visually based on pixel art of a squid (from the 'Splatoon' series) and the logo for Discord for its eyes.
