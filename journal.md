# Enterprise Java course journal
Here, I'll document my progress ans studies in the class.

### Before Class Began
Up to and including 8/29/2022

My memory is a bit vague, but I know I made efforts to get my environment set up.
I did most of the setup by this time, including:
- downloading the VM
- verifying MySQL was set up as instructed
- beginning IntelliJ's setup
- joining the course's GitHub Team
- probably other things I'm forgetting
