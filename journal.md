# Enterprise Java course journal
Here, I'll document my progress ans studies in the class.

### Before Class Began
Up to and including 8/29/2022

My memory is a bit vague, but I know I made efforts to get my environment set up.
I did most of the setup by this time, including:
- downloading the VM
- verifying MySQL was set up as instructed
- beginning IntelliJ's setup
- joining the course's GitHub Team
- probably other things I'm forgetting

### First Week
Week of 8/30-9/5 (Second day of class through Labor Day)

The transition from not having class to having class is usually tough for me. As such I didn't complete as much as I hoped this week, but I did the following:
- Finished set up on IntelliJ
- Activities 1-4
- Exercise 1

### Second Week
Week of 9/6-9/11

I've done a lot of thinking and research to determine what my individual project should be. It was a bit distracting from the week's work, but I did get the following done:
- Researched approaches to linking a TomCat servlet with a Discord application/bot
- Most of Activity 2, all except adding my name and Individual Project repository to the list
- Much discussion over what my project should be, some of how I should approach it, and requirements I will need to fulfill.

### Third Week
9/12

I've been working on catching up on last week today. I feel I've made a lot of progress for just today that includes the following:
- Activity 3
  - Created the Individual Project repository
  - Updated `pom.xml`, `web.xml`, and `.gitignore`
  - wrote a preliminary README file
  - started this journal
- Bonus: Non-Java accomplishments today (I'm in a good mood)
  - Got a review I'm writing for the newspaper to a state where it's about a paragraph away from being ready for review
