# Craig McKinley's Individual Project: "SplatSpot"

This repository is for a project in Madison College's Enterprise Java Class, and is for the part of the project related to the web.

### Problem Statement

#### Probable Primary Endpoint

Finding someone to play a specific game with you isn't always easy. When it comes to "Splatoon 3", a single team consists of four players, and adding AI-controlled players to fill those positions is not an option. While Splatoon 3 does offer its own matchmaking, that doesn't include getting to chat with people that don't already know each other. SplatSpot consists of a Discord server, website, and Java-driven Discord application, that helps players of Splatoon 3 team up and find a team to play against when necessary.

#### Alternative Ideas/Stretch Goals

"Splatoon 3" users like to share moments from their games, both the funny and epic moments! SplatSpot allows users to browse replay codes, video captures, fanart, and memes posted by players of Splatoon 3. It achieves this by storing the codes for replays, and links for other types of media, into a database. They're viewable from the website through a search (thanks to APIs of certain hosts, such as Twitter), and (if using the Discord API) are posted into Discord once they're posted on the web.
