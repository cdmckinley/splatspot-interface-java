# Craig McKinley's Individual Project: "SplatSpot"

This repository is for a project in Madison College's Enterprise Java Class, and is for the part of the project related to the web.

### Problem Statement

"Splatoon 3" users like to share moments from their games, both the funny and epic moments! SplatSpot allows users to browse video captures posted by players of Splatoon 3. It achieves this by storing links of different YouTube posts into a database. They're viewable from the website through user feeds and a collective, all-user feed.
